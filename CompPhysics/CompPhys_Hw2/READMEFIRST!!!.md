# CompPhys_Hw2
Please read this first!
The following files are included: 
- The write-up in PDF
- hw2_overrelaxation is for question 1 (a relaxation file is also there because I modified that to do the problem)
- hw2_wien is for question 2
- hw2_gdescent is for the first part of question 3
- Files called final_attempt.m and finalfinalattempt.m have to do with the second part of the third question
